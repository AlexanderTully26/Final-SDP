# Final-SDP

## Goal
The goal of my final SDP is to learn FTC Java and then demonstrate that knowledge by creating a tulip program to control the robot.

Over this project, I will go from having no knowledge of Java to having a baseline understanding of Java and a more in-depth knowledge of how to code in FTC Java.

## Outcome

Over this project, I learned Java for general code and then moved into more specific FTC Java, learning how to use the different libraries and commands. I applied this knowledge to three final codes. The first was one I used on my team's main robot, which tested all the other motors for errors. The following two parts are linked; in them, I wrote different functions to command the robot's movement, and then I called those functions using a controller to drive a text robot.
